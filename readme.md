## 🪄 Usage

To run the script, use the following command in the project root directory:

```console
python transform-youtube-videos-to-medium-posts.py
```

**The script will:**
1. Fetch recent videos from your YouTube channel
2. Transcribe each video
3. Generate an exceptional well-written article for each video transcript
4. Create 5 most relevant tags for the article
5. Generate an engaging article title
6. Fetch relevant images from Unsplash for the article (one for article header, and 1-2 for content)
7. Embed a few images in the article content using Medium-compatible Markdown format.
8. Post the article to Medium as a draft
9. Save the generated article locally as a Markdown file, so you always keep a copy, with article's details in a markdown yaml-like metadata
10. Clearly mentioning any issues for each publishing step till the end, right in the terminal
11. Automatically wait a few minutes (for each iteration) before publishing a new article to Medium, to prevent being wrongly flagged as spam
12. Sit and relax. Enjoy the work!

**Note:** The script posts articles as drafts by default. To change this, modify the `PUBLISH_STATUS` to "publish" in the `config.json` file.
