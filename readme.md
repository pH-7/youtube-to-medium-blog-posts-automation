# 📝 YouTube to Medium Automation

## ⚡️ The Game-Changer Script You Will Always Be Grateful For!

**Automate the process of converting YouTube video content into Medium articles 🎥📝**

This program not only converts video transcripts extremely well into beautiful, SEO-optimized articles with images and captions, but also removes any "transcript-like" writing. It produces a real, professional article from a video instead.

## ⚙️ Requirements
 * [Python v3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher 🐍
 * A Google account with YouTube API access 🎬
 * An OpenAI API key 🧠
 * A Medium account with [an integration token](https://medium.com/me/settings/security) ✍️


## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/pH-7/youtube-to-medium-blog-posts-automation.git &&
   cd youtube-to-medium-blog-posts-automation
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (required on macOS, which no longer ships Python by default; [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/) protects system-managed packages from being overwritten):
   ```console
   python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```console
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your configuration file:
   - Create a file named `config.json` in the project root directory
   - Add your API keys and YouTube [Channel ID](https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced) to the file as followed:
     ```json
     {
       "MEDIUM_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_MEDIUM_ACCESS_TOKEN",
       "MEDIUM_EN_PUBLICATION_ID": "OPTIONAL_ENGLISH_PUBLICATION_ID",
       "MEDIUM_FR_PUBLICATION_ID": "OPTIONAL_FRENCH_PUBLICATION_ID",
       "MEDIUM_TECH_PUBLICATION_ID": "OPTIONAL_TECH_PUBLICATION_ID",
       "POST_TO_PUBLICATION": true, // Whenever we want the post to be published to a specified Medium's publication ID or not
       "OPENAI_API_KEY": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
       "OPENAI_MODEL": "gpt-4.1", // non-reasoning models like "gpt-4.1", "gpt-4.1-mini"
       "UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY": "YOUR_UNSPLASH_KEY",
       "PUBLISH_STATUS": "draft", // "draft" or "publish

       // Niche configurations
       "NICHES": {
         "self-help": {
           "YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID": "YOUR_SELF_HELP_CHANNEL_ID",
           "SOURCE_LANGUAGE": "fr",
           "OUTPUT_LANGUAGES": ["en", "fr"],
           "UNSPLASH_PREFERRED_PHOTOGRAPHER": "pierrehenry", // Optional. Mention a preferred Unsplash photographer (e.g. pierrehenry)
           "ARTICLES_BASE_DIR": "articles"
         },
         "tech": {
           "YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID": "YOUR_TECH_CHANNEL_ID",
           "SOURCE_LANGUAGE": "en",
           "OUTPUT_LANGUAGES": ["en"],
           "UNSPLASH_PREFERRED_PHOTOGRAPHER": null,
           "ARTICLES_BASE_DIR": "articles/tech"
         }
       },

       // Active niche to process ("self-help" or "tech" or "all")
       "ACTIVE_NICHE": "all"
     }
     ```

     **Multi-Niche Support:**
     - The script now supports multiple content niches (self-help and tech)
     - Each niche has its own YouTube channel, languages, and custom prompts
     - Set `ACTIVE_NICHE` to `"all"`, `"self-help"`, or `"tech"` to control which niches to process
     - Tech niche is optimized for "NextGen Dev: AI & Code" technical content

     Alternatively, you can refer to `example.config.json` in the project.

5. Set up YouTube API credentials:
   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
   - Create a new project and enable the **YouTube Data API v3**
   - Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client ID) for a desktop application. Select **External** for **Use Type**
   - Download the client configuration and save it as `client_secrets.json` in the project root directory

6. Lastly, get your Unsplash Access Key at https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications/new


## 🪄 Usage

To run the script, use the following command in the project root directory:

```console
python transform-youtube-videos-to-medium-posts.py
```

**Selecting which niche to process:**
- Edit `ACTIVE_NICHE` in `config.json`:
  - `"all"` - processes all configured niches
  - `"self-help"` - processes only self-help niche
  - `"tech"` - processes only tech niche

**The script will:**
1. Fetch recent videos from your YouTube channel(s)
2. Transcribe each video
3. Generate an exceptional well-written article for each video transcript
4. Create 5 most relevant tags for the article
5. Generate an engaging article title
6. Fetch relevant images from Unsplash for the article (one for article header, and 1-2 for content)
7. Embed a few images in the article content using Medium-compatible Markdown format.
8. Post the article to Medium as a draft
9. Save the generated article locally as a Markdown file, so you always keep a copy, with article's details in a markdown yaml-like metadata
10. Clearly mentioning any issues for each publishing step till the end, right in the terminal
11. Automatically wait a few minutes (for each iteration) before publishing a new article to Medium, to prevent being wrongly flagged as spam
12. Sit and relax. Enjoy the work!

**Note:** The script posts articles as drafts by default. To change this, modify the `PUBLISH_STATUS` to "publish" in the `config.json` file.
